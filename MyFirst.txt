<h2 style="font-size:150%>The BIO of  Akpapunam Ekenedilichukwu Joshua</h2>
<hr><br> 
<p style="font-size:100%",style="color:powdergreen"> I hold a bachelor degree in chemical engineering and 
I was exposed to procurement queuing and inventory.
 During my Industrial Training, I worked in an organization where I was largely involved in store keeping. 
Working as a supervisor with a leading firm involved in providing cleaning and laundry services for a number
of years coupled with my educational background and my penchant for work and innovation.
I always give my best in all I do and always think of innovative ideas to succeed. 
My personal maxim is that <b>"The Harder I Work the luckier I become.</b> </p>
<br> <p style="font-size:100%",style="color:powdergreen"> My training as a chemical engineering and my current pursuit in 
financial engineering has also equipped
 me with analytical, computational and conceptual skills which are invaluable to carrying out the Job functions.
I am auspicious and hopeful that i will be considered for this opportunity to serve.
I look forward to telling about my personality in an interview. Thanks for your consideration.
